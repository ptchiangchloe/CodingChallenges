# Front End Engineer Coding Challenge #
This is a very fun front end coding test, I've used the HTML,CSS, Javascript and jQuery library to complete the test.

## Setting up and running the application ##

1. Download the project from https://github.com/ptchiangchloe/CodingChallenges
2. Open index.html in your browser, you need internet access in order to request jQuery.
(I have tested on Google Chrome Canary59 and Safari10, which all the functions work. I have also tested in IE11 and Firefox48, they both work except the autofocus() function.)
3. As you open, you will see the input field, then try it out! :)
